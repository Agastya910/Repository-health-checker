# Repository-health-checker
Maintain code quality and identify potential issues with a simple GitHub repository health checker.
Sure, here is a sample README.md file for the project that reads a URL, checks the code quality using Flake8 and Pylint, and reports any errors:


# Repository Health Checker

This project provides a tool to evaluate the code quality of a GitHub repository using Flake8 and Pylint. It analyzes the repository's code for potential errors, stylistic issues, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the following command and provide the URL of the GitHub repository you want to check:
```bash
python check_code_quality.py <repository_url>
```

For example, to check the code quality of the TensorFlow repository, you would run the following command:

```bash
python check_code_quality.py [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
```

The tool will retrieve the repository's code, analyze it using Flake8 and Pylint, and print a list of any errors that were found.

## Requirements

The tool requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

* requests
* subprocess

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests subprocess
```

## Personal Access Token

To access private GitHub repositories, you will need to create a personal access token with the "repo" scope and provide it to the tool using the following environment variable:


GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token>


Replace `<your_personal_access_token>` with your actual personal access token.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the tool to check the code quality of a private GitHub repository:

```bash
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token> python check_code_quality.py <private_repository_url>
```
